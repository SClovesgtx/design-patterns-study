# About

The directory *design_patterns* is a collection of design patterns that I have studied.

Each directory inside *design_patterns* has the name of a design pattern and each one contains three files: 

- **README.md**: with information about the design pattern and an example problem.
- **before.py**: file with the code before applying the design pattern.
- **after.py** file with the code that incorporates the design pattern to solve the same example problem.

I had used the followings references:

- [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/)
- [Mastering Python Design Patterns, Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-python-design-patterns/9781783989324)
